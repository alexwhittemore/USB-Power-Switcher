USB-Power-Switcher
==================

Simple relay-driven design to interrupt power to a USB device/tree.

This board allows an arbitrary single-ended signal (voltage dependant on how you populate the base resistor) to control power to a USB device at an A connection, both normally open and normally closed operation supported.
